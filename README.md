# Hypothesis

Patients with advanced stage breast cancer have shorter survival times compared to those with early stage breast cancer.

Breast cancer stage at the time of diagnosis is important for prognosis and survival outcomes. Earlier detection often correlates with improved survival due to less aggressive disease progression and more effective treatment options. The primary hypothesis is that patients diagnosed with advanced-stage breast cancer have shorter survival times compared to those diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.

Previous studies have established that cancer staging provides a reliable framework for predicting survival outcomes, with earlier stages associated with higher survival rates and better treatment responses.
